# Client_Light

This project is an ESP32-based client for controlling and monitoring room lighting, including manual override and status indication.

## Hardware Schematic

![ESP32 Wroom Schematic](schematic.png)

- **Status light:** Indicates system status using three LEDs.
- **Manual override:** Allows direct control of the room light via a pushbutton.
- **Room light:** Controlled via a relay or transistor (see schematic for wiring).
- **Resistors:** 220Ω for LEDs, 10Ω for room light control.

## Features

- ESP32 Wroom microcontroller
- Manual and remote control of room lighting
- Status indication via LEDs
- Integration-ready for Z.E.R.O IoT system

## Getting Started

- Flash firmware using PlatformIO or Arduino IDE
- Connect hardware as shown in the schematic
- Configure WiFi and MQTT settings in code or via configuration tools
